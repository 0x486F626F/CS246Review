Input/Output
---

```
<< input operator
>> output operator
```
```C++
cin.fail();
cin.eof();
```
```C++
while(true) {
	if(!(cin >> i)) {
		if(cin.eof()) break;
		else {
			cin.clear(); //lowers the flag
			cin.ignore();
		}
	}
	else cout << i << endl;
}
```

Streams
---

```C++
cout << hex << i;
```

To read an entire line, use getline(istream, s) to read from the first unread char in the input stream until we hit a newline.

```C++
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	ifstream f("suite.txt");
	string s;
	while(f >> s) cout << s << endl;
	istringstream str(s);
	int tmp;
	while(str >> tmp) cout << tmp << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

| In C | In C++
--- | --- | ---
equality | strcmp | s1 == s2
inequality | strcmp | s1 != s2
comparisson | strcmp | s1 < s2
length | strlen | s1.length()
concatenation | strcat | s1 + s2

```C++
void printSuiteFile(string fileName="suite.txt") {
	ifstream myfile(name.c_str()); //name must be a C style string
	string s;
	while(myfile >> s) cout << s << endl;
}
```

1. optional parameters must appear last
2. not allowed to follow a default argument with a non-default argument

Overloading
---
```C++
int nagate(int a) { return -a}
int negate(bool a) { return !a; }
```
It is not enough for two function to only differ on the return type

Declaration and Definition
---

* Declaration: assertion that something exists
* Definition: implementation
An entity can be declared as many times as you want.

Pointers
---

```C++
int n = 5;
int *p = &n;	//p contains the address of n
cout << p;		//print out the address
cout << *p;		//print the contents of thing p points to
int **p;		//pointer to a pointer to an int;
pp = &p;
**p = 10;
```

Arrays
---

An array is not a pointer! The name of an array is shorthand for the address of the first element of the array.

```C++
int a[] = {1,2,4,8};
*a == a[0];
*(a + 1) == a[1];
```

Structure
---
```C++
struct Node {
	int n;
	Node next;	//wrong, the compliler dose not know the size of the structure
	Node *next;
};	//Do not forget the ;

Constants
---
```C++
const int maxgrade = 100;
```

A constant definition must be initialized

```C++
const int* p = &n;
```
p is a pointer to a constant int
```c++
p = &m;	\\valid
*p = 7;	\\invalid
```

```C++
int* const p = &n;
```
p is a constant pointer to an int
```c++
p = &m;	\\invalid
*p = 7;	\\valid
```

```C++
const int* const p = &n;
```
p is a constant pointer to a constant int

Passing Parameter
---

```C++
void inc1(int n) { n ++; }
void inc2(int *n) { *n ++; }
void inc3(int &n) { n ++; }
```

Reference
---
```C++
int y =10;
int &z = y;	//z is a reference to y
z = 12;
```

A reference is like a constant pointer with automatic dereferencing. Reference has no identity of its own. z mimics y.

1. cannot leave a reference uninitialized.
2. a reference must be initialized to something that has an address.
3. cannot create a pointer to a reference. (int &*x=)
4. cannot create a reference to a reference. (int &&x=)
5. cannot create a array of reference. (int &x[3] = {y, y, y})

```C++
struct ReallyBig{};
int f(ReallyBig &rb){};
```

1. no copy
2. changes visible to caller
3. automatic dereferencing

Advice: Prefer to pass by const reference for anything that is larger than an int.

Dynamic Memory
---

C++ allocates using new, deallocates using delete

```C++
int *n = new int;
cin >> *n;
int *arr = new int[*n];
delete [] arr;
delele n;
```

Local variable allotted space on the stack, space is automatically reclaimed when variables go out of scope.

```C++
Node getMeANode() {
	Node;
	return n;
}
```
inefficient, returns value is copied.
```C++
Node* getMeANode() {
	Node n;
	return &n;
}
```
Really bad: returing a pointer to a stack allocated variable
```C++
Node* getMeANode() {
	Node *np = new Node;
	return np;
}
Good: Node is allocated in heap

Operator Overloading
---

We can give meaning to C++ operators for any new type we create

```C++
struct vec {int x,y;}
vec operator + (const vec &a, const vec &b);
```

Overloading input and output operators
```C++
ostream &operator << (ostream &out, const grade &g) {
	out << g.theGrade << "%";
	return out;
}
istream &operator >> (istream &in, const grade &g) {
	in >> g.theGrade;
	if(g.theGrade > 100) g.theGrade = 100;
	if(g.theGrade < 0) g.theGrade = 0;
	return in;
}
```

Preprocessor
---

Source code -> Preprocessor -> Compiler -> Assembler -> Linker

```C++
#include <iostream>	//look standard C++ lib (/usr/lib/c++)
#include "vector.h"	//look the lib in current directory
#define VAR VALUE	//preprocessor variable with VALUE (default is empty string)
```

```bash
g++ -DX=15 define.cc
```
X will be defined as 15

```C++
#ifdef X
	block of code
#endif
```

Break your program into:
	* interface file (.h) type definitions and funciton headers
	* implementation file (.c/.cc/.cpp)

Note:

	* Never complie header files
	* Never include .cc files

Separate Compilation: Ability to compile individual pieces of a program and the combine them.

```bash
g++ -c main.cc		//just compile, produce an object file (.o)
g++ -c vector.cc
g++ main.o vector.o	//linker acts as the mathchmakers
```

Global Variables
---

In .h file
```C++
extern int globalvar;	//just declaration
```
In .cc file
```C++
int globalvar;	//definition
```

Include Guard
---

```C++
#ifndef __HEADER_H__
#define __HEADER_H__
...
#endif
```
Advice: Always place an include guard
Advice: Never put "using namespace std;" in your header file
Advice: Always refer cout as std::cout etc.

Templates
---
A class parameterized on one or more types.
```C++
template <typename T> class Node {
	T data;
	Node <T>* next;
	public:
	Node(T data, Node <T>* next) : data(data), next(next) {}
	T getData const {return data;}
	Node <T>* getNext() const {return next;}
};
Node <int> *intList = new Node <int> (1, new Node <int> (2, NULL));
Node <char> *charList = new Node <char> (‘a’, new Node <char> (‘b’, NULL));
Node < Node <int> > *linkedListofList; \\not >> for c++ 03 because >> is overloaded
```

STL: Standard Template Library
---

Dynamic Length Arrays: vector
```C++
for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); i ++)
	cout << v.at(i) << endl;	\\range checked acces
v.pop_back();	//remove last element
for(vector <int>::iterator i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); i ++);
for(vector <int>::reverse_iterator i = v.rbegin(); i != rend(); i ++);
```
v.end() points ONE PAST the last element of the array

Lookup table: map template parameterized on 2 types
```C++
#include <map>
using namespace std;
map < <string> <int> > m;
int main() {
	m["abc"] = 5;
	m["xyz"] = 10;
	cout << m["abc"] << endl;
	m.erase("abc");
	m.count('def");
}
```
iterator returns items in sorted key order.

Compilation Dependencies
---
When to include vs When to forward declare

In a.h
```C++
class A{};
```
In b.h
```C++
#include "a.h"
class B: public {};
```
In c.h
```C++
#include "a.h"
class C {A myA;}
```
In d.h
```C++
class A;
class D {A* pMyA;}
```

Pim Idiom (Pointer to Implementation)
---
client.cc include windows.h. This creates a compilation dependency. Any change to window.h require compilation cliend.cc (even the change is to a private field).
```C++
class XWindowImp {
	public:
	Display *d;
	Window w;
	GC gc;
};	//contains all previously private fields from XWindow
class Window {
	XWindowImp *pImp;
	public:
};
```
